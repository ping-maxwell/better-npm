# better-npm

Every npm package release, vetted before it reaches your `node_modules`.

## Quick start

```bash
npx @better-npm/cli
```

That's it. One line in `.npmrc` and every `npm install` routes through better-npm. Safe packages are served instantly; flagged ones are held for review.

| **Malicious code**       | Static pattern detection + AI analysis of source diffs                        |
| **Typosquatting**        | Blocklist of known typosquats - blocks packages that impersonate popular ones |
| **Supply chain attacks** | Dependency diffing, maintainer change detection, rapid-publish flagging       |


Every new version published to npm is picked up, analyzed, and assigned a risk score. Low-risk versions are auto-approved; high-risk ones are held for further review.

## How it works

```
npm install ──▶ better-npm registry ──▶ npmjs.org
                       │
                scanning pipeline
              (static + AI analysis)
```

Your npm client talks to `registry.better-npm.dev` instead of `registry.npmjs.org`. The registry proxies to upstream npm, but every new version goes through a scanning pipeline before it can be installed.

## Project structure


| Package         | Description                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/registry` | Cloudflare Worker - registry proxy and scanning pipeline |
| `apps/web`      | Next.js dashboard - auth, install activity, admin tools |
| `packages/cli`  | CLI to configure `.npmrc` and sign in                   |
